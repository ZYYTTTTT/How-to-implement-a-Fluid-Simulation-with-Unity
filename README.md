Fluid Simulation in Unity using SPH
Introduction
This project implements a fluid simulation system in Unity using the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method. It's designed to handle real-time simulations of fluid dynamics, supporting between 5,000 and 10,000 particles at a consistent frame rate.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Unity 2019.2.15f1 or newer
Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
bash

git clone https://your-repository-url
Open the project in Unity by selecting Open and navigating to the project directory.
Build and run the project from the Unity Editor.

To run a simulation:

Navigate to the Scenes folder and open MainSimulation.
Hit the Play button in Unity to start the simulation.
Adjust parameters like particle count and simulation speed using the UI sliders.
How It Works
The SPH implementation in this project is based on the Navier-Stokes equations, which calculate fluid properties like pressure, density, and viscosity at the particle level. This allows for complex fluid interactions such as splashing and merging.

Dependencies
Unity Game Engine (2019.2.15f1 or newer)
Examples
To simulate a dam break scenario:

Set the initial number of particles to 10,000 in the FluidSettings panel.
Start the simulation and observe the fluid dynamics as the dam breaks.
